Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

//with contains function, not sure if allowed
function RemoveDuplicates (input) {
  let output = [];
  input.forEach(function(letter) {
    if (output.includes(letter) === false) {
      output.push(letter);
    }
  });
  return output;
}
