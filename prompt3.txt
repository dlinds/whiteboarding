Question #3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"



public static string StringCompressor (string input)
{
  string output = "";
  for (int x = 0; x < input.length; x++)
  {
    int count = 1;
    for (int y = x; y != x; y++)
    {
      if (input[x] == input[y+ 1])
      {
        count++;
      }
    }
    if (count > 1)
    {
      output += count + input[x];
    }
    else
    {
      output += input[x];
    }
  }
  return output;
}
