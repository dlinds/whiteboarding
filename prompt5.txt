Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]




function sortMe (input) {
  for (let x = 0; x < input.length; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < (input.length - x); y++) {
      if (input[y] > input[y+1]) {
        let numSwap = input[y];
        input[y] = input[y+1];
        input[y+1] = numSwap;
      }
    }
  }
  return input;
}
